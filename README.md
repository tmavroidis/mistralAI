My work with Mistral AI

Some of my work includes code that I have inherited for maintenance that I have previously never laid eyes on.
This is troublesome because the code was never documented and I have no idea what the author intended for it to do let alone know what is necessary to change it.
One project in particular had the last modification to the code in 1999 to support the Y2K transition (AKA Y2K bug) that was further exacterbated by the fact that the underlying files used and continue to use 6 digit dates.
It is now being called the Y2038 bug because around that date problems will again start to appear on 6 digit dates except in reverse.
This bug can be remedied by removing the errant code, but before you can do that you need to understand how the bug was handled.
Instead of recoding the programs, the quickest fix was to modify sorts and opnqryf when possible so that the RPG remained unchanged.
Trying to recall all the variations of sort is a task in itself.
I posed the question to mistral AI and was able to at least verify that the changes I proposed to the sort routine were sound.
Here is how the conversation went and how the final product was reached.
---------------------------------------------
Coming into this sort which I am not the author of, but have been asked to make adjustments to I would have to ask the AI to explain what it does.

Although the physical files are externally described, the sort is using positioning to sort the data.

Although the sort doesn't care to know what data is contained in the positions, I as a developer would need to know.

The program that uses this sort uses the RPG cycle so the AI needs to be versed in how it relates to this sort.

After careful consideration and an understanding of the requirement, if all that was asked was to strip out the century, the AI should simply modify the SORT since the testing would be far less intrusive and the change could be completed within an hour. If the requirement was to modernize the code at the same time I would expect the AI to rewrite the entire program in SQLRPGLE and strip out the sort. Then you would need to setup a test environment and complete a full testing cycle. With budget constraints the former would be a better choice.

I ran it through mistral.

PROMPT: [You are an AS400 programmer tasked with making changes to a program that uses sort. Please explain what the following sort does.]

came back with the following 

Certainly! To provide an accurate explanation, I'll need to see the specific sort command or code snippet you're referring to. However, I can give you a general overview of how sorting works on an AS400 (IBM i) system.

In AS400 programming, sorting is often done using the SORT command or through SQL. Here's a breakdown of what a typical SORT command might look like and what it does:
Example SORT Command

SORTA TOFILE(SORTEDFILE) FROMFILE(UNSORTEDFILE) FORMAT(FILE1)

Explanation

    SORTA: This is the sort command. SORTA is used for ascending order, while SORTD would be used for descending order.
    TOFILE(SORTEDFILE): This specifies the output file where the sorted data will be stored.
    FROMFILE(UNSORTEDFILE): This specifies the input file that contains the data to be sorted.
    FORMAT(FILE1): This specifies the format of the input file. It ensures that the sort operation understands the structure of the data it is sorting.

Detailed Breakdown

    Input File (FROMFILE): The data to be sorted is read from this file.
    Output File (TOFILE): The sorted data is written to this file.
    Format: The format specifies the structure of the records in the input file. This is crucial for the sort operation to correctly interpret the data.

Additional Parameters

    KEYFLD: Specifies the field(s) to sort by. For example, KEYFLD((FIELD1 *A) (FIELD2 *D)) would sort by FIELD1 in ascending order and then by FIELD2 in descending order.
    OUTREC: Allows you to specify how the output records should be formatted.
    INREC: Allows you to specify how the input records should be interpreted.

Example with KEYFLD

SORTA TOFILE(SORTEDFILE) FROMFILE(UNSORTEDFILE) FORMAT(FILE1) KEYFLD((FIELD1 *A) (FIELD2 *D))

In this example, the data is sorted first by FIELD1 in ascending order and then by FIELD2 in descending order.
SQL Sorting

If you're using SQL, the sorting is typically done with the ORDER BY clause.

SELECT * FROM UNSORTEDFILE
ORDER BY FIELD1 ASC, FIELD2 DESC

This SQL statement sorts the data from UNSORTEDFILE by FIELD1 in ascending order and then by FIELD2 in descending order.
Conclusion

The sort command in AS400 is used to rearrange the records in a file based on specified criteria. The SORTA command sorts in ascending order, while SORTD sorts in descending order. The KEYFLD parameter specifies the fields to sort by, and the FORMAT parameter ensures the sort operation understands the data structure.

If you provide the specific sort command or code snippet you're working with, I can give a more detailed explanation tailored to that context.

RESPONSE:
The provided code snippet appears to be a sort control file for an AS400 (IBM i) system, likely used with the SORT command. This file specifies how the data should be sorted and formatted. Let's break down the key components and what they do:
Sort Control File Breakdown
Input Control (I) Statements

These statements define the input fields and their positions within the records.

    I C 313 332EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 313 and ending at position 332, labeled as CUPO (1-20).
    IAC 333 337EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 333 and ending at position 337, labeled as (21-25).
    IAC 338 347EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 338 and ending at position 347, labeled as JOB#.
    IAC 448 467EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 448 and ending at position 467, labeled as TXT3 (1-20).
    IAC 468 487EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 468 and ending at position 487, labeled as (21-40).
    IAC 488 497EQC: This specifies a character field starting at position 488 and ending at position 497, labeled as (41-50).
    IAD 12 12GEC4: This specifies a numeric field at position 12, labeled as 20th century (decade within YRSH).

Format Control (F) Statements

These statements define the format of the output fields.

    FNC 183 192: This specifies a numeric field starting at position 183 and ending at position 192, labeled as ASEQ.
    FNP 8 11: This specifies a packed numeric field starting at position 8 and ending at position 11, labeled as PH#.
    FNC 338 347: This specifies a numeric field starting at position 338 and ending at position 347, labeled as JOB#.
    FNC 313 337: This specifies a numeric field starting at position 313 and ending at position 337, labeled as CUPO.
    FFC 0: This specifies a constant field with a value of 0, labeled as 20th century.
    FNP 12 15: This specifies a packed numeric field starting at position 12 and ending at position 15, labeled as YRSH.
    FNP 16 18: This specifies a packed numeric field starting at position 16 and ending at position 18, labeled as ORD#.

Sorting Logic

The sort control file is used to define how the data should be sorted and formatted. The I statements define the input fields, and the F statements define the output fields. The sorting is likely based on the fields specified in the FNC and FNP statements.
Key Fields for Sorting

    ASEQ: Likely a sequence number or identifier.
    PH#: Likely a phone number or another identifier.
    JOB#: Likely a job number or identifier.
    CUPO: Likely a customer purchase order number or identifier.
    YRSH: Likely a year and shipment identifier.
    ORD#: Likely an order number.

Constant Fields

    20th century: A constant field with a value of 0 or 1, indicating the century.
    21st century: A constant field with a value of 1 or 0, indicating the century.

Summary

The sort control file is used to define the input and output fields for the sort operation. The data is sorted based on the specified fields (ASEQ, PH#, JOB#, CUPO, YRSH, ORD#), and the output is formatted according to the F statements. The constant fields (20th century and 21st century) are used to indicate the century.

If you provide more context or the specific SORT command used with this control file, I can give a more detailed explanation tailored to that context.

Then I asked it 

PROMPT: [can you make a change to the sort to remove the century requirement]

Changes Made

    Removed all IAD statements related to the century field.
    Removed all FFC statements related to the century field.

Summary

The modified sort control file no longer includes the century requirement. The sorting and formatting will now be based solely on the remaining fields (ASEQ, PH#, JOB#, CUPO, YRSH, ORD#).


PROMPT: [can you remove the redundancies]

Certainly! To remove redundancies from the sort control file, we can consolidate repeated sections and ensure that each unique set of input and format control statements appears only once. Here's the cleaned-up version of the sort control file:

I'm not sure why it doesn't think the last block is redundant.

PROMPT:  [can this code be modernized using SQL]

Yes, modernizing the sorting process using SQL can make the code more readable, maintainable, and potentially more efficient. SQL provides powerful sorting and filtering capabilities that can replace the traditional sort control file approach.

Here's how you can achieve similar sorting and formatting using SQL:
Step 1: Create a Temporary Table for Sorting

You can create a temporary table to hold the sorted data. This table will have the same structure as your output file.

CREATE TABLE SORTED_TABLE AS (
    SELECT
        ASEQ,
        PH#,
        JOB#,
        CUPO,
        YRSH,
        ORD#,
        TXT3
    FROM
        UNSORTED_TABLE
) WITH NO DATA;

Step 2: Insert Sorted Data into the Temporary Table

Use an INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement to insert the sorted data into the temporary table.

INSERT INTO SORTED_TABLE
SELECT
    ASEQ,
    PH#,
    JOB#,
    CUPO,
    YRSH,
    ORD#,
    TXT3
FROM
    UNSORTED_TABLE
ORDER BY
    ASEQ,
    PH#,
    JOB#,
    CUPO,
    YRSH,
    ORD#;

Step 3: Query the Sorted Data

You can now query the sorted data from the temporary table.

SELECT * FROM SORTED_TABLE;

Complete SQL Script

Here's the complete SQL script that performs the sorting and formatting:

-- Step 1: Create a temporary table for sorting
CREATE TABLE SORTED_TABLE AS (
    SELECT
        ASEQ,
        PH#,
        JOB#,
        CUPO,
        YRSH,
        ORD#,
        TXT3
    FROM
        UNSORTED_TABLE
) WITH NO DATA;

-- Step 2: Insert sorted data into the temporary table
INSERT INTO SORTED_TABLE
SELECT
    ASEQ,
    PH#,
    JOB#,
    CUPO,
    YRSH,
    ORD#,
    TXT3
FROM
    UNSORTED_TABLE
ORDER BY
    ASEQ,
    PH#,
    JOB#,
    CUPO,
    YRSH,
    ORD#;

-- Step 3: Query the sorted data
SELECT * FROM SORTED_TABLE;

Explanation

    Create Table: The CREATE TABLE statement creates a temporary table (SORTED_TABLE) with the same structure as the output file.
    Insert Sorted Data: The INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement inserts the sorted data from the UNSORTED_TABLE into the SORTED_TABLE. The ORDER BY clause specifies the sorting criteria.
    Query Sorted Data: The SELECT * FROM SORTED_TABLE statement retrieves the sorted data from the temporary table.

Benefits of Using SQL

    Readability: SQL is more readable and easier to understand than traditional sort control files.
    Maintainability: SQL scripts are easier to maintain and modify.
    Efficiency: SQL can leverage the database engine's optimizations for sorting and filtering.


My Thoughts:

It failed to realize that the program doesn't just list the data, but also updates 3 fields in the sorted file. That is usually why ADDROUTE was used instead of a regular sort.

It wants to create a temporary table, which is not recommended for performance.

I would have opened a cursor within the RPG program to the data and then been able to update the data within the same program.

It did not take users authorities or commitment control into consideration. Most user profiles would fail with the inability to create tables.

I would give it a cautionary thumbs up for the sort changes and a thumbs down for the modernization. 

I found this useful but would still require an in-depth knowledge of both the application software the IBM i to make a call.

It is more useful as a tool to check my thought on how to handle a problem.   

I replaced the sort leaving out the last duplicated block and presto, IT WORKS!
